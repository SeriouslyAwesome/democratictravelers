Hey <%= @user.first_name %>!

This is just a quick email to say thanks for the suggestion. Now that we have your email, we'll be able to notify you if and when we take you up on it. We also try to send a post card to everyone who suggests something we actually end up doing, as a token of our appreciation.

We went ahead and generated a password for you, in case you want to sign in later and put some more ideas on the map. You can use your email and this password:

<%= @user.password %>

Anyway, thanks again!

Love,
John + Laura (+ Bulleit, Marlow & Papa)
